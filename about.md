Lynbrook Computer Science is an interest group for students of [Lynbrook High School](http://lhs.fuhsd.org/). Our club is open to all, regardless of background. Everyone, ranging from curious non-programmers to experienced competitive programmers, has something to gain from participating. We provide weekly instructional lectures and fun and engaging problems for everyone to solve. Members are also highly encouraged to share anything with the club, such as computer science related projects they have made.
