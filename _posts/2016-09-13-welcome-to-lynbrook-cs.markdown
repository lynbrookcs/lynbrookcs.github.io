We're going to be doing a lot this year! From learning algorithms to building websites and apps to participating in hackathons, there's a lot in store this year.

Sign up [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeb97VUNCCzAbuMcsCxv2bCafzQdBsoWA_mgE-StAu9KBpxuQ/viewform) to get updates about meetings and other events!

Our meetings will be every Monday lunch in Room 608 (tentatively), starting September 13th!
