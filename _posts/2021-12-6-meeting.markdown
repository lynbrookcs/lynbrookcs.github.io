In the final meeting of this year, we talked about MOSS! Also, the first USA Computing Olympiad contest of the 2021-2022 season is coming up on Dec. 17-20!

Our meetings will be every Monday lunch in Room 608 (with Mr. Fulk), so keep coming! Remember: food is NOT allowed in the room due to COVID restrictions.
