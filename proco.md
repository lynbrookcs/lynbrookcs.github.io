Computer Science and Web Development club are hosting Lynbrook ProCo, a programming competition open to all Lynbrook students. Students will compete in teams of up to three to solve challenging coding problems, testing their collaboration skills and knowledge of various algorithms.

Similar to the USA Computing Olympiad, teams will have 4 hours to take the contest and can begin any time during the contest window. HOWEVER, the contest automatically terminates at 8 PM, so please aim to begin by 4 PM if you want as much time as possible.
